# Motion-Detection
 A Python script that uses OpenCV and a Pandas data frame to detect motion.


Some things that I learned/used with this project:
- OpenCV
- Frame matrices
- Delta frames and how they are used in motion detection
- Data Frames
- Determining the amount of time a program elapsed
- Formatting a deltatime object
